# Bayesian-neural-networks  
Note: If you cannot open any notebook, first go to: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ and then paste the url of the notebook page there!  

This project is an exploration into the intersection of the Bayesian Paradigm and Deep Learning. We apply the Bayesian Neural Networks to two different tasks: a regression task using a toy dataset and a classification task using the Wine dataset obtained from UCI ML Repo.
